Tell me again why I should give a damn
Tell me again why I should even care
I gave you everything I had and I swear
There's nothing left here but...
All the anger you left behind
All the hatred I feel inside
We're in the aftermath of a love that died
Keep digging your grave
Keep digging your grave

Take your broken promises
And don't come back again
It's time to say goodbye
I gotta leave you where you lie
Take your broken promises
Every word you ever said
It's time to say goodbye
I gotta leave you where you lie, lie
I gotta leave you where you lie
